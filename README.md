Anki add-on to copy fields from a chosen deck to certain fields in the selected notes.

The addon's dialog can either be accessed from an editor button or from the browser's **Edit > Copy Around** menu item.

There is also a template filter that can be used to show related information from other cards on-the-fly when reviewing. E.g.

```
{{copyaround deck=leech_deck_2 search_in=Expression leech_from=Snapshot,Audio count=2 shuffle=true:word}}
```
